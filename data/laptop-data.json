There is a touch screen model available for a higher price, and a model with both a 128GB SSD and 1 TB HDD together for an even higher price, giving you the best of SSD performance and HDD capacity. All models are within your budget.",

My only concern is the smallish battery inside the laptop. But if you plan to be plugged in all the time then that won't be a concern. Both the i5 and i7 models are within your budget, but I believe the i5 is a better buy as the i7 is merely a clock speed increase.",

This ThinkPad model is the middle tier in terms of pricing and is the most common choice among ThinkPad users. You have the best selection of ports, and arguably one of the best laptop keyboards on the market. The price is higher than everything else on this list, and the listed price is based off a customized configuration that I believe will suit your needs (1080p display, 8GB of RAM). While you can order this model now, the new ThinkPad models for 2018 have just been annouced, and will be slated for release soon. If you want to wait for the latest Intel processors (which are quad-core vs the dual-core of this laptop), then I suggest waiting for the T480 to appear on the Lenovo store.",
